            <em>May 8, 2018</em> – Data is often said to be the “new currency,” as it can serve significant value when companies unlock the arsenal of qualitative and quantitative information that they generate. But sifting through the noise and making
            sense of unstructured data is a challenge, which is where automation and artificial intelligence could help. <a href='https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/08/intel-leads-20-million-investment-in-gamalon-to-help-companies-interpret-customer-messages-through-natural-language-processing/'>Read article</a>

          <p><em><strong>First application of technology enables enterprises to read, understand, and interact with billions of customer messages and provide individual responses</strong></em></p>
          <p><strong>Cambridge MA</strong> – <em>May 8th, 2018</em> – Gamalon today announced the first artificial intelligence system that can process natural language and then explain what ideas are present and how they are organized. Using Gamalon’s Idea
            Learning® technology, one person or a small group can understand what millions of people or customers are saying, and provide individualized responses and experiences. <a href="https://gamalon.com/news/first-ai-that-explains-thinking/#more-596"
              class="more-link">Read more</a></p>
          <div class="extra-content-js" style="display: none;">
            <p>Existing “black box” machine learning approaches to natural language are able to summarize by extracting statistically significant text or to categorize by following human-categorized examples, but these systems have not been able to structure,
              organize, and assemble compositions of ideas and sentiments from text, and then communicate this learned structure of ideas to people.</p>
            <p>“Gamalon’s mission is to accelerate human understanding by combining human and machine learning. It’s easy enough for a business analyst to get started providing return on investment right away. When Gamalon’s Idea Learning technology reads
              large amounts of text, and forms ideas, the AI becomes an extension of you &#8212; allowing you to read and respond to huge volumes of messages” said Ben Vigoda, Gamalon’s Founder and CEO. “In the hands of a data scientist Gamalon can also
              be a sophisticated machine learning tool to perform data prep on many different sources of unstructured enterprise natural language &#8211; you can set it up to populate a target table or schema from the text.”</p>
            <p>This technology breakthrough has driven further investment. Gamalon raised a $20 million Series A funding with lead investor Intel Capital joined by .406 Ventures and Omidyar Technology Ventures. Existing investors Boston Seed Capital, Felicis
              Ventures and Rivas Capital also participated in the round. Other Gamalon investors include Andy Bechtolsheim, Steve Blank, Ivan Chong, Adam D’Angelo, Georges Harik, and Raymie Stata.</p>
            <p>“The powerful advances we’re seeing in machine learning are being enabled by diversification of compute infrastructures and fueled by the fast-growing volumes of complex, free-form text,” said Naveen Rao, corporate vice president and general
              manager of the Artificial Intelligence Products Group at Intel Corporation. “We want enterprises of all levels of AI capability to take full advantage of this growing volume and complexity of data. We think Gamalon’s approach can help users
              better understand billions of customer communications, customize individual responses, and take action to better serve those customers.”</p>
            <p>Gamalon is already used by Fortune 500 enterprises across automotive, finance, insurance, manufacturing and telecommunications to turn millions of free-form customer messages and communication, including survey, phone transcripts, and trouble
              tickets, into actionable data to improve customer experience and retention. Larry Locascio, Senior Manager of Global Client Services at Avaya, has deployed the Gamalon system to audit and analyze their reseller partners. “We had previously
              tried manual approaches that didn’t work very well and took a lot of time to complete. Gamalon’s approach gave us accurate data overnight. We’re now able to scale our audit process from 40 or 50 resellers once per year to 30 to 40 per quarter.”</p>
            <p>.406 Ventures and Omidyar Technology Ventures were also excited to participate in the Series A. “Gamalon has built a platform based on fundamental breakthroughs in machine learning. Its system learns orders of magnitude faster than the state
              of the art approaches, is auditable and is easily extendable to specific domains. Gamalon takes advancements in the space to another level” said Todor Tashev, Managing Partner at Omidyar Technology Ventures. Graham Brooks, Partner at .406
              Ventures added “Their revolutionary technology is reflected in their customer base. We were blown away by the caliber of company that has turned to Gamalon to power critical customer-facing systems and are excited to be partnering with them
              to drive rapid enterprise expansion.”</p>
            <p>The infusion of capital brings the total investment in Gamalon to more than $32 million including the largest single investment by the US Government in next generation machine learning over the past five years. The funding will allow Gamalon
              to continue to invest in R&amp;amp;D and to expand sales and marketing efforts to the enterprise. Vigoda added “The Gamalon system will enable enterprises to improve customer experience and retention, and drive revenue by allowing enterprises
              to truly understand what their customers are saying and to take strategic action, as well as to immediately reply 1-to-1.”</p>
            <p><strong>About Gamalon</strong></p>
            <p>Gamalon uses artificial intelligence to help companies drive action from the millions of customer communications they receive, improving customer experience and retention. Gamalon’s breakthrough platform represents the next wave in machine
              learning: teaching computers actual ideas. Unlike rules-based systems or deep learning techniques typical in most natural language solutions, Gamalon&#8217;s Idea Learning technology provides accurate, editable, and explainable processing
              of customer messages and other free-form data. Gamalon was founded in 2013 by Ben Vigoda, an MIT PhD with over 25 years of AI experience. Gamalon received the largest grant DARPA has ever given for development of next generation AI platforms

          <p><strong>Cambridge, Mass.</strong><em> – Feb 14, 2017</em> – Today, Gamalon, Inc., emerged from stealth mode to announce that it has developed a game-changing new approach to artificial intelligence/machine learning called Bayesian Program Synthesis
            (BPS). Gamalon’s BPS technology &#8211; for the first time &#8211; writes and rewrites its own Bayesian programs. This technology achieves higher accuracy and uses orders of magnitude less computation and training data relative to today’s
            state-of-the-art deep machine learning. <a href="https://gamalon.com/news/press-release/#more-384" class="more-link">Read more</a></p>
          <div class="extra-content-js" style="display: none;">
            <p>Using BPS, Gamalon is announcing the alpha launch of its first commercial application of this technology, <a href="http://newgamalon.staging.wpengine.com/pricing/">Gamalon Structure</a> and <a href="http://newgamalon.staging.wpengine.com/pricing/">Gamalon Match</a>.
              Gamalon Structure converts streams of text paragraphs found in databases or documents, into clean, structured data rows ready for use in the enterprise. Gamalon Match can then de-duplicate/link these data rows.</p>
            <p>Gamalon’s pre-alpha customers are already using the product to accomplish in minutes with twice the accuracy what previously took large teams of people months or even years. The process of generating these results was observed and verified
              by an independent third party, Galois, Inc.</p>
            <p>“We have one customer that, every year, spent nine months and four million dollars to structure and match their data,” said Gamalon’s founder and CEO, Ben Vigoda. “In contrast, Gamalon was able to perform the same task in minutes with twice
              the accuracy. Almost every enterprise that we talk to has large quantities of unstructured text data that they are currently unable to use, so we are very excited to see where this first product can take us.”</p>
            <p>Gamalon is the largest single investment by DARPA in probabilistic programming for advancing machine learning, with approximately $7.7 million in government R&amp;D contracts. Gamalon also recently raised a $4.45 million Series Seed venture
              capital round including industry luminaries Adam D’Angelo, Andy Bechtolsheim, Steve Blank, Ivan Chong, and Georges Harik, led by Aydin Senkut and Niki Pezeshki at Felicis Ventures, and including Nicole Stata and Raymie Stata at Boston Seed
              Capital, Matt Sutton, and Carlos Gonzalez at Rivas Capital. Gamalon has also been identified by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology as one of twenty-five MIT STEX25 startups.</p>
            <p>The Gamalon Structure and Gamalon Match services are now available to select customers as API’s integrated with the Amazon, Microsoft, and Google Cloud platforms.</p>
